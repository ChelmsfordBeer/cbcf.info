	<b><i>A Covers Band With A Twist</i></b>
	<br>
	THE BIJOUX TOOTS love music and it shows. Based on the Suffolk/North Essex border, this talented bunch of musicians focus on strong vocal harmonies, combined with accordion, mandolin, fiddle, bouzouki, guitar, ukulele and double-bass. Where Bluegrass and Folk traditions cohabit with Pop and Rock to bring a refreshingly curious twist to the covers band formula.
