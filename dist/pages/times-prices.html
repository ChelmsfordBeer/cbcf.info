          <ul>
            <li>Payment is by cash or card, on the door.</li>
            <li>Entrance is free for CAMRA members at all sessions upon producing a valid membership card.</li>
            <li>Not a CAMRA member? You can <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/join" rel="nofollow">join CAMRA online</a> or at the festival.</li>
            <li>Due to fire regulations, there is a limit to the number of people allowed on site. When busy, we may have to restrict entrance.</li>
            <li>There is a refundable £3 deposit on all festival glasses, which you can keep as a souvenir. The refund is only available if the glass is not damaged and the refund counter is open.</li>

          <h2 class="h2" class-"centre"><i class="fal fa-id-card" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Age Verification</h2>
          <p>Under 18s are allowed on site, but must be with a responsible adult – a 17 year old with an 18 or 19 year old friend is not sufficient. As at any licensed premises, it is illegal to buy alcohol if you are under 18, or to buy alcohol for
            anyone under 18.</p>
          <p>The festival supports and operates the <a href="//beerandpub.com/campaigns/challenge-21/" rel="nofollow">Challenge 21 scheme</a>; if you are lucky enough to appear under 21, then please don’t be offended if you are asked for ID to prove
            you are over 18. The only acceptable ID is a government issued photo
            ID (photo driving licence or passport) or a card showing the <a href="http://www.pass-scheme.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">PASS Scheme</a> hologram. After your ID has been checked you will be issued with a wrist band to confirm that you are
            over 18. We thank you, in advance, for your cooperation and
            understanding.</p>
