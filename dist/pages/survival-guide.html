      <p>We hope you and your child do not lose each other. However, if this should happen, please do not panic. Please go to membership stand in the middle of the field for assistance.</p>
      <p>Please consider the following suggestions, especially for younger children:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure your child knows they are to ask a member of staff team to help find you.</li>
        <li>Ensure your child knows your name, so we can contact you via the tannoy.</li>
        <li>For older children, make use of mobile phones.</li>
