      <p>How to get the most from your visit to the Chelmsford Summer Beer and Cider Festival</p>

      <h2 class="h2 centre">First Aid</h2>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">Should you need first aid assistance, please ask a member of St Johns Ambulance who are located next to the main entrance/exit at the festival.</p>

      <h2 class="h2 centre">Arrival</h2>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">At the entrance, please have your money ready to help get through quickly during busy periods.</p>

      <h2 class="h2 centre">Drink Lists</h2>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">To help you choose and locate your drink, we provide updated drink lists online via our website that you can install as an app as well as paper copies of beer, cider and key keg listings printed daily.</p>

      <h2 class="h2 centre">Glass</h2>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">Glasses are oversized and lined at the third, half and pint measures. This is to ensure you receive a full measure - something <a href="//camra.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">CAMRA</a> campaigns for.</p>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">If you don't want to keep your glasss at the end of your session, you can return it to the glasses stall for a refund. However, we'd prefer if you took it home as a souvenir - why not start your Chelmsford Beer and Cider Festival glass collection?</p>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">But please remember: no glass, no drink; no glass, no refund.</p>

      <h3 class="h3 centre">Broken glass</h3>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">If you break your glass, please:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Do not try to pick up the broken glass</b></li>
        <li>Do stand over the broken glass</li>
        <li>Ask someone to contact a volunteer for assistance</li>
        <li>Wait for one of our volunteers to come and safely clear the broken glass</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="h2 centre">Getting your drink</h2>
      <h3 class="h3 centre">Help us to help you</h3>
      <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">Here are a few tips to help both you and our volunteers have an enjoyable time:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Please select your choice before getting to the bar and have a second choice in case it's not available</li>
        <li>Volunteers will only serve from the bar at which they are working, so check carefully before ordering</li>
        <li>Beers will be arranged alphabetically by brewery, from left to right as you look at the bars</li>
        <li>Ask for your choice by quantity, brewery/producer name and drink name</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Do specify the amount you want - does "may I try?" mean you want a sample, third, half or pint?</li>
          <li>We often have more than one beer or cider available from the same brewery/producer</li>
          <li>There could be two beers or ciders with the same name, but from different breweries/producers available on that bar</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Please have the correct change, if possible</li>
        <li>We're only human, so please be patient! We try to serve everybody in turn, but when we're very busy it can be difficult to keep track. Note that drawing attention to yourself by banging glasses on the bar or waving money at the volunteers tends to be counter productive</li>
        <li>Enjoy yourselves! If you have any questions, and we are not busy, then please ask. The volunteers link talking about what we've got</li>
      </ol>
