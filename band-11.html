		<b><i>Classic rock at it's best</i></b>
		<br> It’s about 16 years and counting since GUNRUNNER first appeared on the scene. They now have a six piece band who are comfortable with Rock, Blues, Pop, Punk and even a spot of Funk! However, Classic Rock is the true calling for the band and it’s
		those late 1960's and 1970's greats that form the spine of the GUNRUNNER set list. Think Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Free, The Who, Thin Lizzy, Pink Floyd, Steppenwolf, AC/DC, Status Quo, ZZ Top....the list is endless, but you get the picture!
