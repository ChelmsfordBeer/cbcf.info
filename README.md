# Chelmsford Beer & Cider Festivals Website

Public facing website for Chelmsford Beer & Cider Festivals hosted via Netlify on cbcf.info and other subdomains.

This repo hosts the summer and winter festival websites as well as the holding website between festivals.

## Structure

-   Master - Live website for general public - pushed to <https://cbcf.info> (from <https://cbcf-live.netlify.com/>).
-   Staging - Staging website for upcoming changes to content and site code - pushed to <https://staging.cbcf.info> (from <https://cbcf-staging.netlify.com/>).

## Update lifecycle

Due to the way our festivals are scheduled, each year we change the website content between our Winter and Summer festivals - work for this happens between the following times:

- November to February - Winter Festival.
- April to August - Summer Festival.

Outside of these times the website will be put in "holding" and main development work on the site tends to stop.

Please note that the timescales above are a rough guide.

## To dos

-  Finalise content on Winter Festival pages.
-  Start work on offline web app for drinks list (datatables)
